Software modeling helps to visualize the elements necessary to develop a computer system. There are modeling languages that are used to perform this task, however, some developers comment that this phase in software development is very tedious, since the software must be documented and validated before generating the source code. One of the most commonly used diagrams to visualize the computer system is the class diagram. This diagram allows to detail all the classes of objects that will be necessary for the final product to meet the customer's expectations. Other tools exist to take the system and software requirements, including use cases and user stories. Use cases are used to write down everything that the customer mentions about the operation of the software to be performed through a sequence of actions. The developer should pay attention to everything the customer needs to perform using the system. The use cases are the most convenient to write down the customer's needs or system requirements. From everything mentioned by the user who will use the system, the developer begins to recognize the objects to be generated for the subsequent implementation (construction) of the software. Therefore, the objective of this work is to create a JavaScript library that allows to interpret the use cases written with a symbol language that uses the TDDT4IoTS tool (\url{https://aplicaciones.uteq.edu.ec/tddt4iots/}) to mark words that represent elements of object-oriented modeling and generate the structure of a class diagram in JSON and XML format, so that it can then be manipulated using other web libraries to draw class diagrams and any other type of diagram from it.
