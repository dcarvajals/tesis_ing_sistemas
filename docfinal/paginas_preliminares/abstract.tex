Software modeling is used to create an abstract idea of what you want to achieve with a computer system. There are modeling languages that are used to perform this task, but for most developers this phase in software development is very tedious because of the documentation that must be done before generating the source code. One of the most used diagrams to fully represent a software is the so-called class diagram, which allows to detail all the objects that will be necessary for the final product to meet the customer's expectations. To take the customer's requirements there is another type of diagram that is very useful to perform this task, which are the use case diagrams, the customer can mention everything that the software performs, either verbally or in writing. The developer should pay attention to everything that the customer needs for his system, the use cases are the most convenient to write the needs or requirements that the customer has mentioned. From the requirements mentioned by the end user who will use the system, we start to recognize all the objects that must be generated for the software. That is why the objective of this work is to create a javascript library that allows to interpret the descriptions of the use cases written with a symbol language that uses the TDDT4IoTS tool to detail technical data about the objects of the software, and generate the structure of a class diagram in JSON and XML format so that I can then be manipulated by other web libraries that allow to draw other types of diagrams, but with the structure generated by this library can get the class diagram in a faster and more correct way.
